# HR-Analysis-Using-SQL

In this project, I used SQL to perform data cleaning and transformation by employing multiple ALTER, UPDATE, and SET commands to convert raw data into actionable insights. 
I addressed null values, standardized date formats, and ensured data integrity for analysis. 
Leveraging Power BI, I then developed interactive dashboards to effectively visualize employee demographics, providing clear and insightful answers to key analytical questions.
